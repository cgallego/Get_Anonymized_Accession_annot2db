Annotation thumbnail creator.

Made by Martin Durant in 2014 for the Martel Breast CAD group.


Purpose
-------

To produce an image per DICOM annotation for a given directory of
dingle-slice DICOM image files. Typically this will be done during
the process of fetching from clinical PACS, anonomyzing and pushing
to research PACS.

Will maintain a local-file database of all records produced, for
possible later merge with biomatrix.

Produces a logfile of all annotations processed, and can query the
database for any given accession, to aid with filling in the URL
field in biomatrix/exam-finding and provides further information
on lesion location.

Requirements
------------

Depends upon:
numpy
matplotlib
sqlalchemy

Settings
--------

The function main.scan_directory is the only one that should
typically use. It's docstring details the inputs. One can either
hard-code values into the main.pars dictionary, set these values
at run-time, or pass a dictionary of override values to 
scan_directory.

Command-line mode
-----------------

To query the annotation records for a particular accession number,
run 
>python main.py acc
The output will be the same format as scan_directory prints to the
logfile.
